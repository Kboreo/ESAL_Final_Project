N**This program performs two main functions. The first is to calculate the first order transfer function of a motor based on a step
N**input. When the Calibrate function is called and executed a step input sent to the motor with via a PWM signal with 100 percent 
N**duty cycle. The voltage across the motor is reduced by a voltage divider then read into an ADC channel. The motor speed is read 
N**every 10mS and stored in memory until the speed remains constant. Once the speed remains constant the time constant (t) for the 
N**transfer function is calculated by finding the time the motor took to reach its steady state speed multiplied by (1-e^-1). The 
N**gain (K) value is calculated by dividing its final speed by the input voltage. Once these values are known a first order transfer
N**function can be derived in the form k/(ts+1).
N**The second function asks the user for a desired speed then through PWM the microcontroller maintains that speed regardless of the 
N**load placed on the motor. Every 10mS the encoder reads the motors current speed. The difference between the desired speed and the 
N**actual speed is multiplied by a gain and adjusts the PWM signal to compensate for this load. In addition to compensating for the 
N**error between current speed and desired speed the controller also adds compensation for small errors over long periods and 
N**compensation for rate of change.
